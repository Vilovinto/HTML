<h2>Origin</h2>
<hr>
<p>Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_White_Bird">The Little White Bird</a></i> (1902), a novel for
    adults. In chapters 13–18, titled "Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens",
    Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Gardens">Kensington Gardens</a> in London, where the
    fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as
    "betwixt-and-between" a boy and a bird. Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the centre of his <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)">stage play</a> titled <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy">Peter Pan, or The Boy Who
        Wouldn't Grow Up</a></i>, which premiered on 27 December 1904 at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_York%27s_Theatre">Duke of York's Theatre in
        London</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's
    publishers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodder_%26_Stoughton">Hodder
        and Stoughton</a>, extracted the Peter Pan chapters of <i>The Little White Bird</i> and published them in 1906 under the title <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</a>, with the addition
    of illustrations by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rackham">Arthur Rackham</a>.<sup><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Barrie later adapted and expanded the 1904 play's storyline as a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel">novel</a>, which was published in 1911 as <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy">Peter and
        Wendy</a></i>.</p>
<p>J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother
    and brother thought of him as forever a boy.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<br>
<h2>Physical appearance</h2>
<hr>
<p>Barrie never described Peter's appearance in detail, even in his novel, leaving it to the imagination of the reader and the interpretation of anyone adapting the
    character. In the play, Peter's outfit is made of autumn leaves and cobwebs.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> His name
    and playing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_flute">flute or pipes</a> suggest the Greek god and mythological
    character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(god)">Pan</a>. Barrie mentions in <i>Peter and Wendy</i> that Peter Pan still had all his "first
    teeth".<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-chap1-7">[7]</a></sup> He
    describes him as a "lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and
    the juices that ooze out of trees".<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-chap1-7">[7]</a></sup> <i>In The Little White Bird</i> (1902) and
    <i>Peter
        Pan in Kensington Gardens</i> (1906), he is seven days old.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Traditionally, the character has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_boy">played on stage by a petite adult woman</a>.<sup><a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> In the original productions
    in the UK, Peter Pan's costume was a reddish tunic and
    dark green tights, such as that worn by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Boucicault">Nina Boucicault</a> in 1904. This costume is exhibited at Barrie's
    Birthplace.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> The similar costume worn by <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Chase">Pauline Chase</a> (who
    played the role from 1906 to 1913) is displayed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_London">Museum of London</a>. Early editions of adaptations of
    the story also depict a red costume<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> but a green
    costume (whether or not made of leaves) becomes more usual from the 1920s,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> and
    more so
    later after the release of Disney's animated movie.</p>
<p>In the Disney films, Peter wears an outfit that consists of a short-sleeved green tunic and tights apparently made of cloth, and a cap with a red feather in it. He has
    pointed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf">elf</a>-like ears, brown eyes, and reddish hair.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(film)">Hook</a></i> (1991), the character is played as an adult by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Williams">Robin Williams</a>, with blue eyes and dark brown
    hair; in flashbacks to him in his youth, his hair is light brown.
    His ears appear pointed only when he is Peter Pan, not as Peter Banning. His Pan attire resembles the Disney outfit (minus the cap).</p>
<p>In the live-action <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_(2003_film)">2003 <i>Peter Pan</i> film</a>, he is portrayed by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Sumpter">Jeremy Sumpter</a>, with blond hair,
    green
    eyes, bare feet and a costume made of leaves and vines.</p>
<p>In the prequel to the main story <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(2015_film)">2015 <i>Pan</i> film</a>, he is portrayed by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Miller">Levi Miller</a>, a young boy who was
    left as
    a baby by the orphanage until he gets captured by
    Blackbeard's pirates and taken to Neverland. Here he wears just simple clothes.</p>
<br>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<hr>
<p>Peter is an exaggerated stereotype of a boastful and careless boy. He claims greatness, even when such claims are questionable (such as congratulating himself when
    Wendy re-attaches his shadow). In the play and book, Peter symbolises the selfishness of childhood, and is portrayed as being forgetful and self-centred.</p>
<p>Peter has a nonchalant, devil-may-care attitude, and is fearlessly cocky when it comes to putting himself in danger. Barrie writes that when Peter thought he was going
    to die on Marooners' Rock, he felt scared, yet he felt only one shudder. With this blithe attitude, he says, "To die will be an awfully big adventure." In the play,
    the unseen and unnamed narrator ponders what might have been if Peter had stayed with Wendy, so that his cry might have become, "To live would be an awfully big
    adventure!", "but he can never quite get the hang of it".<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup></p>
